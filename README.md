### About me :dolphin:

- a computer science student and a web developer in the making
- in the future I'd like to dabble in VR, machine learning and AI among many other things
- outside of programming I have a passion for learning
- that includes anything that helps understand the world around me
- especially psychology, neuroscience and philosophy
